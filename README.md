# scripts_dump
Wherein I dump scripts for data analysis and just generally picking poorly formated data

-> mzerospace(file1, file2)
Function picks one TXT file (file1) and removes all multiple whitespaces, returns another TXT file (file2) in CSV format (separation by ",") 
Motivation: output file of a sensor that formated in unreadeable tables.
